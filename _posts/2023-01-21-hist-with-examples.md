## Peering Inside Histogram Bins

A histogram is a powerful tool for exploring data.  An initial histogram-based examination will often raise additional questions:
  * Why is this bin so large?
  * Why is this other bin so much smaller than expected?
  * Are there any other features correlated with the distribution depicted in the histogram?

One way to answer these questions is to simply _peer inside the histogram bins_.  This post covers a tool and [notebook in `oarphpy`](https://github.com/pwais/oarphpy/blob/master/notebooks/Histogram_with_Examples.ipynb) for doing exactly that.
